## Indoor Localization

Places like retail stores, museums, libraries are gradually moving towards a more automated experinece for customers. [Amazon Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrmMk1Myrxc) serves as an example where customers can do automated checkout of their items. Towards this end, tracking the activity of the customers in such spaces becomes an important problem that needs to be solved with high accuracy.

Finding by counting is a system which can currently localize moving customers with decimeter level accuracy. 

### Key Features

Finding by counting supports the localization of moving customers with the following features:

*  #### Decimeter Level Accuracy 
      Finding by Counting can find physical co-ordinates of moving customers at regular intervals with an average accuracy of       0.4 meters.
*  #### Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) Medium 
      Unlike other state-of-the-art techniques which use Wi-Fi as a medium and use location of Wi-Fi APs, Finding by Counting       works on BLE beacons than can be attached with items like products in retail stores.
*  #### Use of only Packet Count 
      Most techniques use RSS or strength values of signals from fixed devices like WiFi APs and then map that to 
      distance either through fingerprinting or by deriving a mathamatical model of signal strength decay with distance.
      Finding by Couting ignores RSS value altogether due to its high variance and unreliability in indoor settings.
